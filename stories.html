                If you didn't know this already Cali, I love you. Soooooo much. If I had way more time there's still no way I could fit all of our stories on this website.
                I loved the way we laughed, the way we played, the way we had serious conversations. I don't want our time together to be just a 
                distant memory, or even a sweet college memory. I want you. Forever. I want to race to park benches forever. I want to cuddle with 
                you forever. I want to play with your hair forever. I want to do races up and down stairs forever. I want to go to museums with 
                your forever. I want to be BYU fans with you forever. I want to be tired and goofy with you forever. I want to kiss you forever. I want
                to lay on trampolines with you for forever. I want to listen to and tell you stories forever, and make all kinds of new ones. I want to
                make firsts with you forever. I want torecord our pictures and our days and make everyone jealous of how cute we are forever. I want to
                be clumsy with you forever. I want to cry with you forever. I want to play with little kids with you, and watch and be amazed by how 
                good you are with them forever. I want to be blown away by your rock-solid testimony forver. Cali I want you forever. I can't just see a 
                future with you, I want one. I'm scared of the future, but I hope you know that if you wanted it too, I would have loved to put a 
                ring on your finger, and make you my forever. I love you.
