                <p>Calianne Skinner is a beautiful, intelligent, hard-working, compassionate, fun, amazing woman who grew up in Springville, Utah. Although not as good as its neighbor Mapleton, Springville is a pretty, homey town that is part of what made Cali who she is today.
              <br><br>
Cali attended Springville High, and later Brigham Young University, where she met an incredible group of friends, including one silly boy who never imagined how much this girl would mean to him.</p>
